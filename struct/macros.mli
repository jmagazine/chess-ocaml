    2

val encode_move : int -> int -> int -> int -> t -> t -> t -> t -> t
(** [encode_move source target piece promoted captured double enpassent castling]
    encodes a move for the computer to understand how change the board
    - [source] is where the piece originates from [0 <= source <= 63]
    - [target] is the target square [0 <= source <= 63]
    - [piece] is the piece that is being described [0 <= piece <= 11]
    - [promoted] is the piece that the promoted pawn will turn into
      [0 <= piece <= 11]
    - [captured], [double], [enpassent], and [castling] are binary, represented
      by either [UInt64.one] or [UInt64.one] *)

(** [get_enpassent_move encoded_move] returns true if the this is an enpassent
    move *)
